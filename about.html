			<h2>Origins:</h2>

			<p>Keith Money, a biographer of Anna Pavlova, wrote that a hotel chef in
			Wellington, New Zealand, created the dish when Pavlova visited there
			in 1926 on her world tour.</p>

			<p>Professor Helen Leach, a culinary anthropologist at the University of
			Otago in New Zealand, has compiled a library of cookbooks containing
			667 pavlova recipes from more than 300 sources. Her book, The Pavlova
			Story: A Slice of New Zealandâ€™s Culinary History, states that the
			first Australian pavlova recipe was created in 1935 while an earlier
			version was penned in 1929 in the rural magazine.</p>

			<p>The Australian website "Australian Flavour" gives the earlier date of
			1926 for its creation, suggesting that Home Cookery for New Zealand,
			by Australian writer Emily Futter, contained a recipe for "Meringue
			with Fruit Filling". This recipe was similar to today's version of the
			dessert.</p>

			<p>It has been claimed that Bert Sachse created the dish at the Esplanade
			Hotel in Perth, Australia in 1935. In defence of his claim as inventor
			of the dish, a relative of Sachse's wrote to Leach suggesting that
			Sachse may have accidentally dated the recipe incorrectly. Leach
			replied they would not find evidence for that "because it's just not
			showing up in the cookbooks until really the 1940s in Australia."
			(However, a 1937 issue of the Australian Women's Weekly contains a
			"pavlova sweet cake" recipe.) Of such arguments, Matthew Evans, a
			restaurant critic for The Sydney Morning Herald, said that it was
			unlikely that a definitive answer about the pavlova's origins would
			ever be found. "People have been doing meringue with cream for a long
			time, I don't think Australia or New Zealand were the first to think
			of doing that."</p>
